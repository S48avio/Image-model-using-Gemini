<u><b>Gemini-Pro</b></u>
<br>
Gemini Pro is a large language vision model that understands input from text and visual modalities, such as images and videos, to generate relevant text responses. It is designed to be multimodal and can scale across a wide range of tasks. Gemini Pro is capable of visual understanding, classification, summarization, and creating content from image and video inputs. It can process visual and text inputs like photographs, documents, infographics, and screenshots. Additionally, it can perform tasks such as visual information seeking, object recognition, digital content understanding, structured content generation, and captioning and description. It also has the ability to reason compositionally and infer new information without memorization or retrieval.
